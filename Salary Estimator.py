This file's purpose is to train a nueral net using tensorflow. The NN will be able to make predictions
for a baseabll player's fantasy baseball salary value, based off given projected stats

This is for a personal project where I develop a fantasy baseball draft toolkit for my custom league. 
The winner of my league gets $600+ and as of developing this, my team has finished 7th place four years in a row.
The cutoff of winning any money back is 6th place so my co-owner/brother and I are a little annoyed. I hope that this
toolkit will provide us with an advantage for evaluating players and forming a draft strategy. Even though you don't necessarily 
win your league on draft day, you can have a massive head start and it is possible to lose the league at the draft.
