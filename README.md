# Fantasy-Baseball-Tensorflow-Machine-Learning-Model
Personal Project to use Tensorflow to create a ML model that will help me produce the best draft plan for my custom fantasy baseball league

Milestone 1
• On Feb 6
th – accumulate and clean all offensive historical
data to train over
• Bonus: Have pitcher data prepared as well
• Stretch: Begin construction of model

Milestone 2
• On Feb 18th - produce somewhat accurate salaries based
off league history for offensive players
• Bonus: produce somewhat accurate salaries based off
league history for both offense and pitchers
• Stretch: Be able to produce all salaries with greater than
90% accuracy

Milestone 3
• On March 2nd - use predicted salaries to produce random
offensive plan
• Bonus: use predicted salaries to produce random offense
and pitching
• Stretch: use predicted salaried to produce a coherent team
• Includes closers and utility players

Milestone 4
• March 16th - produce offensive plan that passes the “eye
test”
• Bonus: produce entire team plan that passes the “eye test”
• Stretch: produce entire team that looks better than a
personal plan
• John and I manually make personal draft plans that we
bring into the draft. The “Eye test” is looking at it and
saying “that looks ok.” Beating a personal plan would be
providing a combination of players that would
outperform one of our own plans based off projections

Milestone 5
• March 22nd - Draft Day, the model can produce an optimal
offense
• Bonus: The model can produce an optimal offense and
self update during the draft
• Stretch: The model can produce an optimal offense and
pitching rotation
• Bonus Stretch: The model can produce an optimal entire
team plan and update live during the draft

Milestone 6
• Apr 30th - produce plan that achieves top 6 for 2018 data
• Bonus: Our draft outcome has been satisfactory and
helped us be top 6 at this point in the season
• Stretch: Our draft outcome was tremendous and we are
top 3 in the league due to our hot start
